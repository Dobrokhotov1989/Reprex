```{r include=FALSE}
## Set working directory
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = here::here())
```

## Child2

```{r libs-2, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
```


As a workaround I can glue `here()` to the file path to be independent from current working directory. However, it is not so convenient. Setting a project options to evaluate chunks in the project directory is not an option, because it makes document dependent on the local settings.
```{r message=FALSE}
my_df <- read_csv(file = glue::glue("{here::here()}/Data/mpg.csv"))

head(my_df) %>%
  kable(format = "html",
        caption = "Test data") %>%
  kable_minimal(full_width = FALSE)
```
